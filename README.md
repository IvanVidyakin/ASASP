=============================
Welcome to the automated system of accounting of students' progress.

> Note: the program is developed as a project work and is distributed exclusively for informational purposes.

INSTALLATION
------------
The system consists of two parts: an SQL database and a C# application. First of all, you need to install the database structure on your computer by running the mydb.sql file.
After that, you can launch the C# application and use it like any other.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
To execute the .sql script, a mysql server is required. I was developing a database for version 5.7, but newer versions, as far as I know, do not have backward compatibility issues. For convenience, I recommend using MySQL Workbench, which provides a more convenient environment than the command line.
MS Visual Studio is required to run the application. Install the most up-to-date one for your system.

WHAT'S NEXT

Please share your opinion about the program. There is no problem in using fragments of it when creating your own non-commercial products, especially educational ones.
